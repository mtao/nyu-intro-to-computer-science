## Deployed site

View the [schedule](https://nyu-java-programming.github.io/course-materials/schedule) and [syllabus](https://nyu-java-programming.github.io/course-materials/syllabus), which contain links to all deployed course materials.

## Running locally

The code in this repository is used to generate the course website using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and continuously deploy it using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

It is possible to run the website locally on your own machine.

- Assuming [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) is installed...
- Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) globally
- Install the dependencies listed in the `Gemfile` by running the command, `bundle`.
- run `bundle exec jekyll serve` or simply `jekyll serve` if that doesn't work.
