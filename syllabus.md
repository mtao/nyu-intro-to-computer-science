# Syllabus

## Course description

How to design algorithms to solve problems and how to translate these algorithms into working computer programs. Experience is acquired through projects in a high-level programming language. Intended primarily for computer science majors but also suitable for students of other scientific disciplines. Programming assignments.


### Lectures

Lectures are held on Monday and Wednesday from 3:30-4:45 at
238 Thompson St (GCASL) Room 279
, but check announcmenets on [Brightspace]({{ site.brightspace_url }}) as well.


### Office Hours
Office hours on Tues from 3-4pm, and are on the fifth floor of [60 Fifth Ave](https://goo.gl/maps/4qP6JmPEsjGqUHvt8) at room 506.

<!--
The grader will provide additional office hours on Thursdays from 3-4pm, via zoom:

### Textbook

Introduction to Java Programming, Brief Version, 10th edition, by Y. Daniel Liang

It's a good book but I will not be following it directly.

## Learning objectives

Upon completing this course, students will be familiar with some of the foundations of computer science, including:

- Java programming language
- Primitive data types
- Selections, a.k.a. branching and control statements
- Loops
- Methods
- Single dimensioned arrays
- Mult-dimensional arrays
- Object orientation (i.e. objects and classes)
- Abstract classes and interfaces
- Inheritance
- Strings and text I/O
- Exception handling
- Recursion

## Getting help

Help resources available to you are listed in order of urgency of your problem:

### Brightspace Discussions
Try asking a question using Brightspace Discussions. Maybe others have had the same issue.
The instructor will be periodically checking the Discussions as well and will answer questions when appropriate.

### Tutoring

Tutors for this course are waiting to answer your questions during dedicated tutoring hours. Use tutoring for more involved questions and when you prefer a more immeidate answer.
Information on tutors will be available in the near future.

### Talk with the instructor

For any issues at all, contact the instructor:

- see me before class
- raise your hand or simply speak during class
- see me after class
- come to my open office hours - hours to be distrubuted in class

### Additional tutoring resources

Additional academic support is also available through the [University Learning Center](http://www.nyu.edu/ulc).

## Attendance & participation

Attendance is mandatory. In-class and online message board participation is encouraged. Students who do not attend class regularly and who do not participate in discussions tend to do poorly.

## Required software and hardware

All students require access to a computer on which they can write programs using a specific set of applications. Computers at any of the university's computer labs will do, as will any laptop or desktop computer.

### Computer labs

Windows and Mac computers are available to you in the [labs](
https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/teaching-and-learning-services/studios-and-computing-labs/student-technology-centers-computer-labs.html
).
You do not need your own computer nor do you need to purchase any software.
However, you will be learning how to use various programs and may wish to have
access to them at home or on your laptop. In this case, you must purchase your
own license or use a trial version, which is sometimes available from the
publisher. You can download software provided by ITS to all students by going
to the
[software page](
https://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/computing-support/software/software.html
).

#### Saving your work in the lab

You will be able to save your work in the ITS labs on your own flash drive, or
online cloud storage services such as [Box.com](https://nyu.box.com) or [Google
Drive](https://drive.google.com). Although you can write to the storage drives
of the machines in the labs, you cannot be sure that you will have access to
the same machine the next time you enter the lab and the drives in the lab are
frequently erased.

## Grading

You will receive a grade calculated mechanically on the following rubric.

- 10% online quizzes
- 15% in-person quizzes
- 20% assignments
- 20% first midterm
- 20% second midterm
- 20% final exam

### Quizzes

Quizzes are completed outside of class on [Brightspace]({{ site.brightspace_url }}) and due by the date they are specified on the [schedule](./schedule).

### Assignments

Assignments are posted on Brightspace and submitted through using Gradescope, which you can access through Brightspace.

### Late policy

All assigned work is due _before_ class on the due date indicated on the [schedule](./schedule)

- for every 24 hours that work is late, we apply a 10% penalty on the grade, up
  to a maximum penalty of 30%.
- after 72 hours, we will no longer accept the work.
- for any group work, each member of the group will be penalized individually.

### Extensions

Students are automatically granted 2 late assignment extensions of up to 3 days
late each, with the exception that all assignments must be submitted before the
last day of regular classes before the final exam period.

- when submitting an assignment for which you would like to use one of these
  automatic extensions, you must notify the grader that you are using the
  extension, otherwise your assignment will be rejected.
- for group work, each member of the group must use an extension (or lose
  points if none is available) for the entire group to submit work late.
- _No additional extensions will be granted._

### Regrade requests

If a student requests a regrade of any work, we will regrade the work in full,
not just the part that the student believes has been mis-graded.


## Academic Integrity

Working with others and leveraging all resources available to you is a
prerequisite for success. This is different from copying, cheating, plagiarism,
and mental laziness. All submitted work must be your own. There are very
reliable systems we use to detect plagiarism in computer code, such as
[moss](http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/) and
[compare50](https://github.com/cs50/compare50). If you submit any work that is
not your own, you risk failure or worse.

Please read the [Computer Science department's policy on academic
integrity](http://cs.nyu.edu/home/undergrad/policy.html) and the
[University-wide
policy](https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/academic-integrity-for-students-at-nyu.html)
which supercedes it.
